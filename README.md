# Upload AI

## A Node application that upload videos and transcript video to generate title and description

The idea behind the project is to upload videos and, based on a prompt, model and temperature, a title and description will be generated by the AI. Changing prompt or temperature will result in different texts.

It's also a part of my personal portfolio, which I use to explore OpenAI APIs to understand better how an AI works and think in some use cases, both for study and to apply in future projects
